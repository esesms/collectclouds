#forlornOr perhaps I’d draw wispy Snow White clouds to blush with the rising sun so you’d feel their velvety softness cradle you. Or if your sky were a tongue you’d be able to taste the clouds like cotton candy melting on the tip of your tonguei wonder what clouds taste like?Flaming Lips - 20 years after clouds taste metallic: boy I wish they were still like this. The polished sound of future albums brought them to bigger audiences yet there is something perfectly encapsulating of alternative sounds via this album.

@AOC Does your ban on combustion engines apply to the military? Will the military have to ground all aircraft, tanks, etc. or do you think the government can invent an entirely new engine to replace combustion engines in the next 10 years?@blairwaldorrfff There are places in our galaxy we can’t describe, like exoplanets, clouds that taste like beer, planets made out of diamonds but if there’s one thing that’s more indescribable than all of these things, it’s the beauty I see when I look at you. :)Walking on the dark bridge
